Semantic elements are tags that directly describe its content to the browser and developer. Where as, non-semantic tags only indicate that content is held in them without directly specifying their content. Some examples of semantic elements include <header>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>. Semantic tags help enhance the accessibility by making the codeâ€™s content easier to read and understand through its consistency. Therefore, creating a better user experience. Consistency is important because developers can use non-semantic tags in a multitude of different ways to specify the same thing conveyed in a semantic tag. This is beneficial when code is shared between different developers. Semantic elements ultimately contribute to a less cluttered and more structured code.
